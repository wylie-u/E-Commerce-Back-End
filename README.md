# E-Commerce-Back-End

# Description

This project creates an e-commerce site utilizing Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

This built in command-line application allows a manager at an internet retail company to use a functional Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The user will need to enter schema and seed commands to create a database in order to work with test data. The command npm run start runs a package.json script to invoke the application, starting the server and syncing the Sequelize models to the MySQL database.

The user will use Insomnia Core to test the API routes for categories, products and tags, which will be displayed in a formatted JSON. API GET POST PUT and DELETE routes allow the user to successfully CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE data in the database.
