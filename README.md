# E-Commerce-Back-End

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database



Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:


Category


id


Integer.


Doesn't allow null values.


Set as primary key.


Uses auto increment.




category_name


String.


Doesn't allow null values.






Product


id


Integer.


Doesn't allow null values.


Set as primary key.


Uses auto increment.




product_name


String.


Doesn't allow null values.




price


Decimal.


Doesn't allow null values.


Validates that the value is a decimal.




stock


Integer.


Doesn't allow null values.


Set a default value of 10.


Validates that the value is numeric.




category_id


Integer.


References the Category model's id.






Tag


id


Integer.


Doesn't allow null values.


Set as primary key.


Uses auto increment.




tag_name

String.





ProductTag


id


Integer.


Doesn't allow null values.


Set as primary key.


Uses auto increment.




product_id


Integer.


References the Product model's id.




tag_id


Integer.


References the Tag model's id.







Associations
You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:


Product belongs to Category, and Category has many Product models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.


Product belongs to many Tag models, and Tag belongs to many Product models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the ProductTag through model.
